Our Aim:
We set out to build a game that would teach 10-14 year olds the importance and value of saving and investing.
Through research online (https://www.kidsmoney.org/teens/saving/statistics) we discovered that teenagers had been saving as little as 1.9% of their money on average, and teenagers were getting less money-savvy with time.
We know it is essential to understand the importance of saving, and that these skills should be taught and implemented from a young age, and our game intends to help develop some critical thinking regarding spending and saving habits, especially in the need to diversify a portfolio and how to accumulate capital over time through investments.
However saving is a very hard concept to get your head around, when your 10-14 years old, and have no necessary payments to make. Why shouldn’t I just buy a toy now instead of later? To get past this mindset, we really wanted to show these kids that by saving money, you can actually make more money.
Our main focus is to show kids that long term investing is capable of increasing your money by huge amounts, a concept hard to understand when you want a Lego model now, not ten years down the line. We decided the best way to teach them was to let them see for themselves, through an interactive investing game
We knew that if they weren’t engaged by the game, kids love to beat each other, and could then compete for top spots on the leaderboard, learning how to better save and take care of money as a by-product.

Our Game:
Our game spans ten levels, and gives the player the opportunity to make their own portfolio, with investment choices based on common real life investments, with volatilities modelled from their real life performances.
At the end of each level the player has the chance to see each investments performance, summarised as a percentage increase or decrease, granting them understanding that many choices can go up and also go down.
The player is also given a yes/no question to answer each round, from a pool of 40 questions, with the opportunity to win a bit of extra cash if they can demonstrate some money awareness skills.
There is also a chance each level for a surprise challenge, where the player has the opportunity for some extra cash
At the end of the game, the player is shown their profits, and their inflation-adjusted profit (assuming 2% inflation). This is key because it shows players that inflation can eat away at your money, and often keeping savings in cash is simply not enough.
The player is presented with a score, based on the money they made and the questions they answered correctly, and is then entered onto the leaderboard, so they have a chance to come back and beat their score, whether by better investing, or better knowledge for the questions.
As the game spans ten levels, it is highly unlikely that overcommitting to one investment choice will pay off at the end, therefore to achieve the best scores, the kids will have to diversify based on risk, and answer all the questions correctly, meaning they will learn a lot about how and why to save money.

Our Website:
We know kids aren’t going to enjoy playing a game on a boring plain website, so we tried to bring ours to life. We did this by making it very user-friendly and by using bright colours and our unique logo to make the experience as enjoyable, easy, and memorable for the kids.
